# Introduction-R
The repository contains the knitted RMarkdown notebooks for an introduction course to the statistical programming language R. The course was held in March 2023 at the University of Siegen (Germany). The course is designed for students with some basic knowledge of statistics. Prior experience with other statistical programming languages (e.g., STATA) is helpful but not required. The course is organized into four sessions and one homework:

- Session 1: Introduction to R and R Studio; creation and manipulation of objects (vectors, matrices, data frames, and lists)
- Session 2: Basic programming in R (if else structures, loops, writing own functions)
- Session 3: Importing and preparing survey data in R (with Tidyverse)
- Homework: Preparing the ALLBUS 2021
- Session 4: Data visualization (ggplot), descriptive statistics, regression models

For sessions 3 and 4, participants need access to the ALLBUS 2021 data set. The ALLBUS (Allgemeine Bev√∂lkerungsumfrage der Sozialwissenschaften) is a yearly survey of the German population, comparable to the General Social Survey in the US. It started in 1980 and, since 1986, is conducted by GESIS. The ALLBUS 2021 data are available for free after registration under: https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA5280.

The materials are suitable for self-study. Students should open the knitted RMarkdown notebooks, type/copy the R code from the notebooks, and try to run the code in their own RStudio window.

Especially sessions 3 and 4 benefitted heavily from the *R for Data Science* book written by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund (available under https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
